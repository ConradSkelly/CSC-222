# essence of object oreanted programming
## what is *code rot*; why does it happen
### what is code rot
1. code rot is the gradual degradation of software code quality over time, and the code becomes harder to maintain, understand, and modify due to factors like poor design choices, lack of updates, changing technology landscapes, and inconsistent coding practices
2. to put it simply its the accumulation of technical debt
### why does code rot happen
- Unorganized code
- inconsistent coding practices
- poor design choices
- lack of updates
- changing technology 
- premature optimization
- people rushing to get software out
## What is the *design* of a software product?
- the source code is the design of the software project as it is what is used to make the product 
- the binary is the final product
## what is the essential characteristics of object orientated design
- high level modules should not be dependent on low level modules instead they should be dependent on some abstraction in between
- example your high level module of displaying a GUI should not be dependent on the low level module of the code instead it should be dependent on an extraction of the code also known as a function.
