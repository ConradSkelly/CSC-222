Found out
Treasures are always lost
Pleasures and rage combined
I'm watchin' you
Be careful with your moves

Tonight
I think the time is right
I think the blood has dried
It cries for more
So what are we waiting for?

Wires and chains
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
Starting to fade
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
Feels like a game
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
You have to play
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)

Lights out
Is this who you really are
Can't look into your eyes
Your twisted mind
It's dark, so dark

We end it now
It ends right here, right now
Please tell me you brought the iron
Let's light up the sky
And fade into the night

Wires and chains
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
Starting to fade
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
Feels like a game
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
You have to play
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)

The days when it was good are gone
I'm tryna' see what it was for, but I'll never know
And though it's dead I hear the call

Wires and chains
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
Starting to fade
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
Feels like a game
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
You can't escape
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)

Wires and chains
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
Starting to fade
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
Feels like a game
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)
You can't escape
(I'm just tired of looking the other way)

I found out
Treasures are always lost
Pleasures are long forgotten
Who are you now
